# Hi, I’m Saurav 👋  

I’m a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst** with a strong foundation in **Statistics, Machine Learning, and NLP**, focused on building **interpretable, end-to-end data solutions** — not just models that score well, but models that *make sense*.

I enjoy working at the intersection of:
- statistical reasoning  
- machine learning  
- real-world decision making  
- and model explainability  

---

## 🧠 What I Care About

- Turning messy data into **clear insights**
- Building ML models that are **accurate AND explainable**
- Understanding *why* a model behaves the way it does
- Writing clean, reproducible, production-aware code

If a model can’t explain its prediction, I don’t consider it finished.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools**
- Python, SQL (MySQL)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Power BI, Excel

**Machine Learning**
- Regression & Classification
- Tree-based models (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Model evaluation & validation
- Feature engineering

**Explainable AI**
- SHAP (global & local explanations)
- Model interpretability & diagnostics

**Deployment**
- FastAPI
- Serialized model inference
- RESTful ML APIs (local)

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Regression Case Study with SHAP
**End-to-end regression analysis with model explainability**

- EDA & feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Global explainability (feature importance, interactions)  
- Local explainability (single-prediction breakdowns using SHAP)

> Focus: understanding *why* the model predicts what it predicts.

### 🔹 ML Model Deployment with FastAPI
**RESTful ML inference service**

- Serialized model loading
- FastAPI-based prediction endpoint
- Input validation using Pydantic
- Local deployment for real-time predictions

> Focus: bridging the gap between notebooks and usable ML services.

## 📊 Current Focus

- Strengthening **statistical foundations**
- Advancing in **machine learning & explainability**
- Improving **model deployment & MLOps awareness**
- Building **portfolio projects that reflect real-world thinking**

## 📈 What I’m Working Toward

- Data Scientist / Data Analyst roles  
- Teams that value **reasoning over hype**
- Problems where data actually influences decisions
